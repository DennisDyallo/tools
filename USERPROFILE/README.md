Hi! These are some files to get you up and running a bit quicker.

1. Place the contents of this folderin your **USERPROFILE** folder. E.g *C:\users\dendya01\\*
2. Edit and add your GitHub Access Token in the **.env-file**. Feel free to add any other variables you might find useful!

You will now have one place to define variables for your WSL's, Git Bash's and Powershells. 
The files .bashrc and Documents/Powershell/Microsoft.Powershell_profile.ps1 contain scripts to set and unset SR proxy settings. Check them out!

Happy coding!
